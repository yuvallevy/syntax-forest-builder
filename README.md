Create constituent trees in a simple WYSIWYG fashion, without using labelled bracket notation.

Continued from [syntax-tree-builder](https://github.com/yuvallevy/syntax-tree-builder).

Early demo sort-of-available at [yuvalinguist.space](https://yuvalinguist.space/npbloom/), but currently still heavily under
construction, with help and testing from the great people over at Tel Aviv University!
