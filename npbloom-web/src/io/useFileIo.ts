   * This means that if the user opens a file using the system file IO, we need to clear the active file name in the browser file IO
   * to prevent confusion (such as when importing a file using the system file IO on top of an already open file in the browser file IO).
   * This is not ideal, but it's a tradeoff we make to keep the two systems separate so the user doesn't get confused between them. */
